# xl-fem

xl-FEM is free FEM software in the form of Excel Macro-Enabled Workbooks for Finite Element analysis. xl-FEM includes xl-FRAME,  xl-TRUSS and xl-BEAM.

xl-FRAME can be used for analysis of static loading of 2D frames consisting of a maximum of 30 nodes and 30 elements. Small displacements, linear elastic material and rigid connections between elements are assumed. Point loads can be applied at nodes and uniformly distributed loads can be applied to elements. Zero or non-zero displacements can be prescribed at nodes. Results include support forces, displacements and section forces, displayed graphically and in tables.

xl-TRUSS can be used for analysis of static loading of 2D trusses consisting of a maximum of 30 nodes and 30 elements. Small displacements, linear elastic material and hinge connections between elements are assumed. Point loads can be applied at nodes. Zero or non-zero displacements can be prescribed at nodes. Results include support forces, displacements and normal forces, displayed graphically and in tables.

xl-BEAM can be used for analysis of static loading of beams consisting of a maximum of 30 nodes and 30 elements. Small displacements, linear elastic material and rigid connections between elements are assumed. Point loads can be applied at nodes and uniformly distributed transversal loads can be applied to elements. For analysis of beams with axial load, use xl-FRAME. Zero or non-zero displacements can be prescribed at nodes. Results include support forces, displacements and section forces, displayed graphically and in tables.
